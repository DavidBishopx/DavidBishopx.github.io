<p>Our alarm systems might be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge a violation. Once a zone has actually been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line.
