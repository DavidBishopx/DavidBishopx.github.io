We got in touch with customer assistance, which offered a complimentary replacement system-- despite the fact that the warranty had actually long given that ended.</p>
<p>The cover of darkness isn't enough to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does end up being a little bit of an issue is in between finding and tape-recording movement. It takes a 2nd for the camera to in fact turn on when it finds motion due to the fact that the Pro 2 does not do constant video recording. If a dubious bad guy was fast enough, they could surpass the camera before it had time to tape them.</p>
