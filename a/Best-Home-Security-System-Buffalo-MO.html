<p>A system that requires a contract might be a clever choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Due to the fact that contract-based security systems typically do not come with upfront costs. Rather, the costs are spread out over the length of the contract. We have actually seen 1-year, all the way approximately 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>

Bear in mind, most indoor cameras need to be plugged into a wall socket, which might restrict where the camera sits.
