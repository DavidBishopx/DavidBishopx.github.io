<p>The other significant decision when selecting a home security camera is whether you require an indoor or outdoor  camera. Outdoor cameras will often be constructed to be more durable and able to survive rain, frost, or damp.

With wireless security, your cameras, sensing units, lights and other security equipment are all linked to one base station or panel to get sensing units required to manage your equipment including enabling, disabling and sending you instantaneous alerts. When a signal is received, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, text, web, or email portal. If your wireless home security system is professionally monitored, they'll also get an alert to instantly assist you with emergency situation responders as needed. </p>
