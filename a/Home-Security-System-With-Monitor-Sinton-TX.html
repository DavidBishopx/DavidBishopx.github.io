<p>I described that all we would need to do is tap into any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, which camera would become the interface into the VMS system. When a client pushes the emergency button, it sends out double informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the danger and, if needed, might just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>

<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to ignore objects that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
