<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers understand that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
