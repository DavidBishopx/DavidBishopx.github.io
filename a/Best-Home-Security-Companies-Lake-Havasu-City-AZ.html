<p>Primarily, it's difficult to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, however it's much better than a great deal of cameras that are four times the rate. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after nearly 2 years of night, day and use images have actually constantly been clear, and we never ever had problems with the camera missing motion, an issue we came across when testing the Wyze Webcam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a creative function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion found. We've seen it highlight vehicles, moths, and mice.</p>

Which's what Nest offers you.</p>
<p>Every wireless home security system comes with a selection of Entry Sensors. The magnetic sensing units are easily installed on doors, windows, and other entry points.
