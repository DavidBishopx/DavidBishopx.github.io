<p>A taut wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires.
