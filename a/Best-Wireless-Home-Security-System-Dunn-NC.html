<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video in dark conditions.

Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. If catching footage in the dark is a top priority, ensure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
