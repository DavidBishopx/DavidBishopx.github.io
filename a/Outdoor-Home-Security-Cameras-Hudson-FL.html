Strategies consisted of searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV evaluation research study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV examinations, and getting in touch with leading researchers to ask about upcoming examinations. Both released and unpublished reports were included in the search, which was not restricted to the English language and was worldwide in scope.</p>
