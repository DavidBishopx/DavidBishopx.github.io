<p>Even though 1080p is typically the basic resolution for cameras we've checked, there are advantages to designs with higher-resolution sensing units.

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it records a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice?
