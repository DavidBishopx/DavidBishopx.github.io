Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
