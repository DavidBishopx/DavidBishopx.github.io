<p>Expenses for systems vary. Larger systems that provide full-house protection with expert monitoring are the most expensive options. Smaller, self-monitored systems are the most affordable choice. Keep in mind that cameras with two-way audio normally work like walkie talkies. You push a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's occurring on the other end. And while this is a pretty basic feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is fairly unusual in outdoor security cameras.</p>
<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect complacency because it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
