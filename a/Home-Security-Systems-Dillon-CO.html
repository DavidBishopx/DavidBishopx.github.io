As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal because the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
