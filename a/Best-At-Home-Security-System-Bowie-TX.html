<p>Nevermind how terrific the cameras are. The first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your information to third party companies? I have actually dropped my Nest Cams because they were purchased by Google. Something all of us require to think of. Sirens. So your camera has actually identified intruders or wild animals.
