<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
<p>The passive infrared (PIR) motion detector is one of the most common sensing units discovered in household and small company environments. It offers inexpensive and trusted functionality.
