<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>

<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not particularly innovative, so we're really recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan alternative.

But if you might upgrade to a new office with different security needs, contract-free is your best bet.</p>
