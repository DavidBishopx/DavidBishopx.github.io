<p>Because they work using a digital signal which can be saved straight to a computer system, these cameras do not need a video capture card. The signal is compressed 5:1, however DVD quality can be accomplished with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a somewhat lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of area to be used up versus the quality of picture needed or desired). The highest image quality of DVD is just somewhat lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
