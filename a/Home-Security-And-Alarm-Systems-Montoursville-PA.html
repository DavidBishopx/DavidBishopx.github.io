<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously remarkable piece of innovation. For beginners, it looks stunning: the all-white style and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily similar to the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey). It's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you may call to mind when you envision a home security camera. The very first wireless function to think about is the security system and its components, and how they all link. In the past, every monitoring element was hard-wired back to a panel box.

We have actually seen it highlight mice, moths, and automobiles.</p>
