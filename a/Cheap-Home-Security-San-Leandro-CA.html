<p>The majority of the self-monitored starter kits don't consist of outdoor cameras. Outdoor cameras are a little harder to install considering that they need to be installed to a home.

We love that the system includes a wifi security camera and just signals you when motion is produced by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false informs). However, you do require to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensors have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have essential fobs and extra sensors, too.</p>
