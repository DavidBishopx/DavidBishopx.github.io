<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you desire to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the agreement.. So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I was in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Really frustrating. Once again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not mention the 3 year commitment. I called their customer support group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to discuss it, it's on you to check out the small print.

Regardless of that, the alarm needs to be enough to frighten intruders most of the times.
