<p>Wireless systems, on the other hand, frequently use battery-powered transmitters which are easier to install and have less expensive start-up costs, but might stop working if the batteries are not kept. Depending upon range and building and construction products, one or more wireless repeaters may be required to bring the signal to the alarm panel reliably. A wireless system can be moved to a new home quickly, a benefit for those who lease or who move often. The more vital wireless connection for security is the one in between the control panel and the monitoring station. Wireless monitoring of the alarm safeguards against a burglar cutting a cable or from failures of an internet provider. This full wireless setup is frequently referred to as 100% wireless.</p>
