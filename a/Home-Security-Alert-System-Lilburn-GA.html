The home automation options were the most excellent we have actually seen from any company.</p>
<p>The ADT Indoor security camera links to your ADT security system to help secure your home. It's constructed with motion detection, night vision and 720p HD video quality.

We chose 2 local home alarm companies in Seattle to compare to the national companies: Protective Systems Inc., and Absolute Security Alarms. Image resolution: A lot of outdoor cameras stream 1080p video. If a camera does only 720p, you shouldn't be paying more than $100.</p>

You push a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's taking place on the other end. And while this is a quite standard feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is relatively uncommon in outdoor security cameras.</p>

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we could point them at the same area and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather condition.
