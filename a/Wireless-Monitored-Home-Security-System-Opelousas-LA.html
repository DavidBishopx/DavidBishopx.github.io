<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not especially groundbreaking, so we're truly recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will likewise like Nest's contract-free plan option. Sure, you get a lower rate if you opt for a three-year agreement, but given that Nest needs you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a big dedication. So choose what will be the much better offer for you. Go with the contract and gain those savings if you understand you'll stay put for at least 3 years. However if you might update to a new office with various security needs, contract-free is your best bet.</p>
