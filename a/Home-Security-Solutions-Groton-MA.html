Now, the majority of security systems involve a variety of components, such as a base station, security camera, glass, motion, and entry break sensors, a keypad, and key fobs, among other parts.

Whatever the elements are (camera, motion sensor, window sensor, clever lock, etc.), I wish to ensure that they all easily interact with your app that is always at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>
