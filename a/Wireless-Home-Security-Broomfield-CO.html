As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular because the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers recognize that the economical consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
