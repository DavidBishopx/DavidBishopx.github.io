<p>After evaluating lots of wired and wireless choices, the best home security camera for the majority of people is the Arlo Pro 2. It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be established both inside and out, as it's weather resistant.

We like that Frontpoint doesn't have a contract, and its equipment prices is incredibly reasonable, so it's not an overall splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>
