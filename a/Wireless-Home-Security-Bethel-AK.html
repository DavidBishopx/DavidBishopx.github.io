<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely regular because the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
