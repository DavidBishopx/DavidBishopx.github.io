<p>The very first thing I take a look at in a security system are its system components. Home security industry is trying to provide new devices and technology is evolving. Now, most security systems include a variety of parts, such as a base station, security camera, glass, entry, and motion break sensors, a keypad, and key fobs, to name a few components.
