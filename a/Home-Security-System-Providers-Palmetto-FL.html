<p>After screening, we sent each of our top choices, along with the Wyze Camera v2, to Costs McKinley, head of details security at The New york city Times (Wirecutter's parent company), for hack screening.

<h2>Mobile Video Surveillance Palmetto</h2>
<p>This is the best-scoring clever alarm we checked. It was extremely basic to establish, as the parts are pre-paired to the base station, and it fasted to activate when any of the sensors were activated.

The guidelines are extremely extensive and the 200m range of the alarm system indicates it can be used to secure sheds and garages in addition to your home.

<p>Whether you decide to opt for a DIY system or opt for a professionally set up system, you'll need to pay a yearly or monthly cost if you need monitoring, and in some cases, you'll be hit with a month-to-month cost to pay off the cost of hardware components. With most DIY systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Kit, the Ring Alarm Security Kit, and the Nest Secure, you buy the hardware outright and can prevent any regular monthly charges if you choose to self-monitor. If you add monitoring, fees will vary: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 monthly for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 monthly.

<p>Firstly, it's difficult to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, however it's better than a great deal of cameras that are 4 times the cost. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after almost 2 years of use, night and day images have constantly been clear, and we never ever had problems with the camera missing motion, a problem we encountered when testing the Wyze Camera Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a smart feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion found. We've seen it highlight mice, moths, and automobiles.</p>
