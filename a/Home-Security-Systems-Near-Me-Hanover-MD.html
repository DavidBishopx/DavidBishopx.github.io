<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically sophisticated outdoor camera we've evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and people, so it cuts down on incorrect alarms, and it can even identify individuals you've labeled (after a knowing duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>Activity notifications inform the user whenever considerable activity is spotted near the camera. Find out if you can get alerts through push notices, text messages, and or email.
