<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially discovered Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it quickly became a staff (and friends and family) fave. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send alerts, you can't manage it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see during the night. If recording video in the dark is a concern, make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
