We first saw Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it quickly ended up being a personnel (and friends and family) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out signals, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

Operators at the station see the signal and take suitable action, such as getting in touch with property owners, notifying cops, or dispatching private security forces. Such signals might be transmitted via dedicated alarm circuits, telephone lines, or the web.</p>
