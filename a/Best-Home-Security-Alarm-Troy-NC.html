<p>From monitoring doors and windows, to ensuring the pool gate is secure, to getting a message when your safe is accessed, or perhaps protecting the medication in the restroom cabinet - the sensing units are small enough to use distinct protection not used with hard-wired alarm systems. Cameras with motion detection can send you alerts when the camera observes motion within its field of view. These notices can alert you to suspicious activity so you can monitor the circumstance.</p>

Now, many security systems involve a multitude of parts, such as a base station, security camera, motion, glass, and entry break sensing units, a keypad, and key fobs, among other elements.

Whatever the elements are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, wise lock, and so on), I wish to ensure that they all quickly communicate with your app that is always at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>
