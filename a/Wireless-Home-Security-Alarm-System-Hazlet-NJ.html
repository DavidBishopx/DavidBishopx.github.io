<p>One of the top home security suppliers given that getting in the business in 1992, Protect America supplies service for hundreds of thousands of customers around the United States and Canada. They provide flexibility in their equipment and offered plans, enabling property owners to choose the security option that best suits their requirements. Regrettably, there are some downsides to Secure America suggested by their low C- ranking from BBB. A majority of the complaints center around false information relating to the compulsory three year agreement. In reality, the majority of clients were not conscious they were making such a long term commitment. This, combined with the extreme charge for premature cancellation-100% of the remaining balance plus spending for all of the equipment-may provide some pause in picking Protect America as their home security option.</p>
