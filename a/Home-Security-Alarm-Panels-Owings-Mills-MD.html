<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
<p>The disadvantage? It's very easy to dedicate security mistakes that will leave your home vulnerable.

Still, the unmonitored system is much less costly and therefore is still the much better alternative for numerous who are just worried about cost. </p>
