<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare individuals and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
