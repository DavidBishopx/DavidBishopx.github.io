<p>While every property owner worries about burglaries, uncertainty has actually surrounded home security systems due to their typically high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces frequently leading to false alarms. A security camera system is a whole video surveillance system connected together by a series of security cameras and network video recorders, providing dependable video monitoring around your home and business. 145 years ago, we invented security and alarm monitoring services.
