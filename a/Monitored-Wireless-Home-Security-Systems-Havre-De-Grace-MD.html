<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security professionals looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. The smart bit is that the camera not only identifies that people have entered its 130-degree field of vision, however it will likewise have a stab at identifying them too. Perhaps more usefully, if somebody passes who the camera doesn't understand, you get an alert about an "unknown face". You can tell the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it need to immediately understand.</p>
<p>Some property owners post decoy alarm indications hoping they'll discourage prospective burglars. These signs might be attached to a front door, a popular window, published in the front lawn, or at the top of a driveway.

<p>We also take a look at the features that are readily available through the camera's app. Does it have such things as adjustable motion zones? If you live on a hectic street, you don't want the camera recording video and informing you each time an automobile drives by. A good home security camera ought to likewise have a scheduling function, so that you can turn it off while you're home, and on when you leave.</p>
<p>SmartThings supports Arlo Pro, Arlo Pro 2, the Pro Base Station, Arlo Q, and Arlo Q Plus. You can trigger a video clip or a SmartThings automation if your camera discovers motion or noise. This series of events also operates in reverse. For example, if someone opens your front door when your SmartThings system is set to away," you can tape-record a clip and sound your Arlo siren (which happens to be the loudest of the three sirens). Or, if Arlo Pro finds a noise, you can have your lights set to switch on. Regrettably, the combination with SmartThings still has bugs and not everything works as it should; however, the capacity is still there.</p>
