In 2007, I contracted with ADT to install a home security system and monthly theft and fire monitoring. The overall installation charge alone was not cheap-- a number of thousand dollars.</p>
<p>The Hive View provides great 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation activated too quickly, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to by hand stop notifications (and recording, given that it does that even when notifications are off). We likewise experienced above-average connectivity issues, with two Hive test systems detaching eight times over two months.</p>
<p>Because it's more complex than it ought to be, we don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, notifies, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently discovered action missing out on, thanks to irregular and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive strategy, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and features are practically identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are a little more pricey for the very same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation fees are onerous, and its prices is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyway.</p>
<p>It's not practically security from theft, either.
