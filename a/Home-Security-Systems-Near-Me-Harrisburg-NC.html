As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal given that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
