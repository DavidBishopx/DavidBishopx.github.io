<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular given that the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
