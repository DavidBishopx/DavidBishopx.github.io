<p>A wired security camera can can be found in 2 types, both requiring wires to provide power and for the functions of video transmission. The camera's seeing angle determines how much area the camera will cover. Wide-angle lenses decrease the number of cameras needed to monitor your home.

<p>Video and image feeds have proved invaluable for surveillance - however there's space for more functionality by utilizing audio.
