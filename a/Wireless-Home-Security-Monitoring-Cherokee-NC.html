<p>When the alarm company agent has made an appraisal of your security needs, ask him for a composed proposal and a copy of the agreement you will need to sign. Take a while, look it over, and think about it. Check the alarm company's track record by calling Bbb, or contacting the Florida Department of Business Specialist Policy or the Alarm Association of Florida. You should also think about two additional estimates from trustworthy companies and compare expenses.</p>
<p>Home security companies offer a wide range of equipment alternatives, from mounted control board installations to fully automated systems managed by smartphones or tablets.

<p>So what occurs if something activates your alarm but you're in a meeting with a supplier and you don't get the alert? Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed vacation and your spotty cell service suggests you don't get informed until the next day? If your system equipment includes an audible alarm, the sound might scare off would-be intruders-- if you're lucky. But the cops will not come until you personally call them. </p>
