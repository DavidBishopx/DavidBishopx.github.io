We love that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll need numerous Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get pricey. It's likewise worth noting that it needs to be installed on the ceiling (it only keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.
