<p>Since it's more complex than it must be, we don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, alerts, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for one month.

Aside from a new "Works with Ring" program to bring compatible smart locks and other third-party gadgets into the fold, there's nothing all that ingenious about it, though Amazon Alexa users will appreciate the two-way voice feature, that they can equip and deactivate the system using voice commands and that they can use Ring's sensors to trigger Amazon Alexa routines.</p>
<p>Also called eyeball" cameras, the turret camera has a ball-and-socket joint to let you specifically redirect the field of vision without remounting the security camera each time. They're fantastic for warehouses. Some of these might resemble dome cameras, however there's a simple technique to differentiate them - if the lens and the IR LEDs are in front of the glass on the housing instead of consisted of behind it, you have actually got a turret camera rather of a dome.</p>
