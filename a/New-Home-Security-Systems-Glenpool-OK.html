<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on two AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it catches a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone notices and live views were painfully sluggish, and the variety is bad.
