<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical since the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
