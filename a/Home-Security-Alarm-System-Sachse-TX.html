<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on 2 AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it captures a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smartphone alerts and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is poor. Also, if the camera is in the middle of recording, don't expect to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>

It's well worth investing time in investigating home security systems in order to acquire peace of mind understanding that you've selected the right system to safeguard your home and household. </p>
