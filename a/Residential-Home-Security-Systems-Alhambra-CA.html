<p>Analog security cameras transfer lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can deal with such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

When recording 4k security camera video, this can end up being a a great deal requiring terabytes of video. For lesser archival needs, you can generally get away with much less.</p>
