<p>You can trigger the 80dB alarm if you do encounter a home invasion emergency situation. I am slightly dissatisfied by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food mill whereas lots of other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm must be enough to frighten burglars for the most part. To recover costs and hold alarm companies responsible for incorrect alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company must be accredited, pay any registration or incorrect alarm costs, and supply physical proof like camera footage or a damaged window to require authorities reaction.</p>
