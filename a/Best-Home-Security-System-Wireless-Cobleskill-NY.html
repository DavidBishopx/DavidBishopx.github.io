<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to overlook items that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.
