The implicit reason for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the risk of terrorist attacks. However suicide assaulters are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and might even be drawn in to the television coverage cameras can make sure - and the expense of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up roughly 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the minimal advantages that the system may supply in examining attacks or tried attacks after the reality (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>As the cover asserts, this year might be a tipping point for Security, Monitoring & Smart Home-- After a year of development, alarm companies prepare to weather a world of unknowns.

<p>Security: There have been a lot of headings about hackers compromising home cameras, baby screens, and other Wi-Fi gadgets to spy on individuals, so make sure to inspect what actions has actually each maker required to eliminate this problem. Try to find a camera that supports current wireless security protocols, such as WPA2, and make sure it encrypts internet transmission of your user name, your password, and the live feeds. Never install a security camera (or a router or any other device on your home network) without changing its default user ID and password.</p>
<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to discover it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect sense of security because it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
