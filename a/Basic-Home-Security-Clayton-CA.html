<h3>Home Security Surveillance Cameras in California</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that Nest cameras aren't professionally monitored-- that part's on you. (The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) However since the majority of retail theft wouldn't trip an alarm anyway (a staff member slipping some additional money while giving a client modification, for example), we think it's more vital to have top quality images so you have the proof you need. And that's what Nest offers you.</p>

The Floodlight Web cam also has a loud speaker, so you can talk with whoever's in front of the camera, and hear their responses.</p>
<p>What we like: Allied Home Security is a local company and Brinks home security dealer that offers totally free exact same day installation and complimentary activation. Their system alternatives consist of modern-day equipment, like doorbell cameras, and they provide clever home and home automation packages on par with Fort Knox and national players. Allied Home Security can install a new system or activate an existing system in your house.</p>

Which, you picture, would be enough to send out even the most dedicated profession criminal scuttling empty-handed down the road. </p>
