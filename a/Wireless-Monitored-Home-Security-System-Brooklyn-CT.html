<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send out smartphone signals with that info when they appear at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
