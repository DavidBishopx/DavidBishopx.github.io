<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal because the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
