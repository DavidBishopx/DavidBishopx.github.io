<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many burglar alarms work the specific very same way. They use open and closed circuits to move an electric current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door enables the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal because the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the store.
