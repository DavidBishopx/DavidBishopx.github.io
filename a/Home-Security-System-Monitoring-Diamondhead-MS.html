This, in turn, is linked to your alarm, and, in monitored cases, can be connected to an external company through a Web or telephone connection.</p>

This camera provides a variety of functions consisting of a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I reviewed a Swann camera I described it as decidedly middle of the road.
