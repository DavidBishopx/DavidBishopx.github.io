<p>Due to the fact that they work utilizing a digital signal which can be saved directly to a computer system, these cameras do not need a video capture card. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be attained with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a greater compression ratio than 5:1, with a somewhat lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of area to be taken up versus the quality of image needed or wanted). The greatest image quality of DVD is just a little lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>

<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by a professional home security company. When the system identifies a break-in, fire, or other emergency, it informs the security team and, in some cases, emergency responders.
