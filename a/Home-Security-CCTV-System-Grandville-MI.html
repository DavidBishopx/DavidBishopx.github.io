<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and frequently over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trustworthy, but not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for additional electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera independently, usually through 110VAC power. </p>
