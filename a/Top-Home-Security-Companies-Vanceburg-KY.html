<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
<p>Your security system will be monitored by our operators at our own UL Listed central monitoring station. All of the cameras in an offered system require a central video recorder in order to transfer and archive the video they are capturing. DVRs developed from the older VCR designs, while NVRs represent the next action in the development of video recording technology. Here's a side-by-side take a look at how NVRs and dvrs compare.</p>
