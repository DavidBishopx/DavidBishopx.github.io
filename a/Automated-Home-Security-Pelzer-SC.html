<p>Among the top home security providers because getting in the business in 1992, Protect America supplies service for hundreds of thousands of customers around the United States and Canada.

Regrettably, there are some disadvantages to Protect America suggested by their low C- score from BBB. A majority of the complaints center around false information relating to the obligatory 3 year contract. In fact, many customers were not mindful they were making such a long term dedication. This, paired with the extreme charge for premature cancellation-100% of the staying balance plus paying for all of the equipment-may give some pause in choosing Protect America as their home security service.</p>
