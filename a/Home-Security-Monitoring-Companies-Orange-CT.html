<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable television and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can deal with such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

Monitors can be linked to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be set up to interact via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>Smart gadget combination: If you have a home full of wise devices, consider searching for a security camera or an all-in-one home monitor that consists of a Z-Wave, ZigBee, or-- ultimately a Thread-- radio that can link them.

This enables the camera or monitor to respond to different scenarios, such as taking a photo when your Nest Protect detects smoke, or informing your Philips Shade clever bulb to turn on when unexpected sounds are identified.</p>
