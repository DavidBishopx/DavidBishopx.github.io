<h3>Wireless Video Security System in Urbandale IA</h3>
<p>During our research study we faced a number of surprises. For one the vast majority of home security system informs to the police are false alarms.

<p>We don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complex than it must be. Recordings, signals, and integration all require separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>Frontpoint uses 5 packages and two monitoring strategies: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester chose the Interactive plan but ended up dissatisfied with its absence of live video surveillance. When she received an alarm notification while on vacation, she had no chance of assessing whether her home had actually been burglarized or if her feline had managed to trip the sensing unit. It turned out to be a false alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
