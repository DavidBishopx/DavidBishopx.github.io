<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it offers protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to identify it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just a false sense of security considering that it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
