When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those individuals and will send smartphone notifies with that details when they appear at your home.

We also found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
