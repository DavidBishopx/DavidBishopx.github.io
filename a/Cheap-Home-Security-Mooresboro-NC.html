If the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits, which implies. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door enables the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
