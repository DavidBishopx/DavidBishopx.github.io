The other notable things about the Pro 2 are that unlike the Q Plus (the other Arlo design which I'm going to discuss in simply a second), it is created for outdoor along with indoor usage, so it'll work come rain or shine. It likewise has a USB slot so you can record your footage directly onto there, which conserves you needing to handle the cloud storage system discussed above.</p>

<p>To determine response times for the monitoring company, we triggered each system a minimum of 5 times, using contact and motion sensing units. However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls must be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs confirmation from a private security personnel. Several cities also need a license to even operate a home and own security system. Guidelines such as these are created to limit the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Many towns will fine you for a lot of incorrect alarms.</p>
