<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>What truly sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be pricey but is vital. In fact, we do not suggest buying this camera at all unless you plan to add the membership. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera found activity. Being able to compare an individual and a cars and truck, for example, permits you to minimize unnecessary informs. And Activity Zones are a good perk, specifically if you're wanting to monitor a specific corner of the lawn, an entrance, or even garbage cans. </p>
