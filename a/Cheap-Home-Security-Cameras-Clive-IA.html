	<meta name="description" content="Home Security System Review in Clive Iowa - Earlier surveillance systems had a lot of dependence on human operators, it is lately that automated systems are being preferred because of their better efficiencies and reliability 1 It has been seen that surveillance with full human operators' involvement has certain inadequacies like the high cost of labor, variations in long-duration capturing and limited ability for multi-screen monitoring 2 Traditional surveillance systems are being complemented and even replaced by the advanced intelligent surveillance systems (AISS), as the latter is used in identifying abnormal behavior and patterns in videos by developing artificial intelligence technologies, pattern recognition, and computer vision.">

<h3>DVR Security Camera System Clive IA 50325</h3>
<p>Numerous other models were disqualified due to performance issues. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.
