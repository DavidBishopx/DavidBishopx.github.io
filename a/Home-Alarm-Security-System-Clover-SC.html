<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers understand that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
