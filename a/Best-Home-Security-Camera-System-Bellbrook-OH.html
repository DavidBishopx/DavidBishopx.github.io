On the simpler side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of smart home equipment for versatility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, however you can't add a ton of other clever home tech to the system. It will not deal with loads of wise home equipment from other companies. The app is extremely excellent, and while the level of control does not match SmartThings, developing 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or turning up the heat when you trip the motion sensor in the early morning - are refreshingly simple.</p>

Flood lights can deter vandals or scare them away, however as a single tool, they are more for your peace of mind than for home protection.</p>
<p>London has more than 10,000 CCTV cameras whirring away 24 hours a day. Giving consumers the option of a more full-service security offering, beyond offering alarms and other gadgets a la carte, makes good sense for a couple of reasons.
