<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night.

This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for further circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera separately, normally through 110VAC power. </p>
