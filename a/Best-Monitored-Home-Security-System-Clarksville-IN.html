<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and frequently over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for further circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera separately, normally through 110VAC power. </p>
