In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires verification from a personal guard. A number of cities likewise require an authorization to even own and operate a home security system.

Cameras are quite standard for self monitored alarm systems, particularly due to the fact that incorrect alarms is a really real possibility.</p>
