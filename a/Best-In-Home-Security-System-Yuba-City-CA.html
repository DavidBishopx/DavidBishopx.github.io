<p>In the past, a surveillance security system generally included a number of cameras connected-- either hardwired or wireless-- to a digital video recorder (DVR), which recorded the images and displayed them on a closed circuit television (CCTV) or monitor. Nowadays, it's much easier to have a standalone security camera. Whether you have one camera or a number of, they work with your home's internet network to send video right to your computer or mobile phone. A lot of consumer cameras save data internally, on a removable microSD card, or remotely on the cloud.</p>
<p>Flood lights are frequently used in combination with motion detectors. When sensing units detect movement, the lights light up the surrounding area, which will permit you to see who is on your property and will potentially scare off burglars.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

The app is slick and good, matching the camera's own cool design, and you can control the Circle via Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit or among Logitech's Pop wise home buttons.</p>
