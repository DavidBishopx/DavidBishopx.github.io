<p>I discussed that all we would need to do is tap into any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, which camera would end up being the interface into the VMS system. When a patient pushes the emergency button, it sends out double notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the danger and, if needed, might just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>

<p>Many home security systems offer extra sensors that supply protection beyond keeping out burglars. These sensors help you safeguard your home from things like floods and freezing temperature levels. Smart sensors take information from the physical environments to find modifications in the environment that might signify difficulty.
