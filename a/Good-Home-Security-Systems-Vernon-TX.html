<p>After we used the Anker EufyCam for nearly six months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to deliver on its promise of approximately one year of battery life.

We should keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the image quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day.
