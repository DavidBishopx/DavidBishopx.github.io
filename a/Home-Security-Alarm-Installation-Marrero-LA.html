<p>Another important topic to go over is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand how much suffices. In this post, the term resolution" refers to the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video image; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about four times as much picture information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.

Many home security companies allow you to transfer your system to your new location with little inconvenience, especially if it has DIY installation alternatives.
