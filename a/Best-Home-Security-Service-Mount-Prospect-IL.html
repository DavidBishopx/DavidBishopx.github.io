<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly common. If a house owner forgets their secrets and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is triggered by a community cat, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
