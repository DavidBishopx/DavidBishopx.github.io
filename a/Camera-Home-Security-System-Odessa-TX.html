<p>The main reasons to opt for a professional monitoring service are the increased security of having a live person checking if the alarm isn't shut down within a certain period of time, and getting in touch with the authorities to do a welfare and come check if there isn't an answer, or a distress code is offered.

<p>Some wireless home security systems offer a video recording storage choice and others do not. For the ones that do not, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home any time you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is tape-recorded. The systems with video storage typically consist of either a local storage or cloud storage choice. A local storage choice saves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the device itself. This choice is generally cost-free. A cloud storage alternative conserves your video in the cloud. Nevertheless, this is usually a paid service and the variety of hours it will keep will depend on just how much cloud storage you want to spend for.</p>
