They support a full spectrum of wireless security features, including video monitoring, home automation, sensing units to avoid an ecological disaster, and medical alerts. ADT's wearable panic button enables immediate access to emergency dispatchers. The panic button is waterproof and sends out a GPS signal with the alert to ensure that dispatch understands where the alert was triggered. You can wear the pendant as a locket or bracelet, or you can clip it to your clothing. Unlike medical signals by other security companies, the ADT wearable panic button works all over AT&T covers, even when you're far from home.</p>
<p>Safeguard America's Do-It-Yourself security plan uses a setup process that is user-friendly and simple. All of the equipment is pre-programmed prior to shipping, so clients need only to install sensing units in their windows and entranceways.
