<p>While you need to pay for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it is among the more economical memberships out there at $2.99 a month. This is a pricey security camera, but we think it deserves the financial investment. Increasing release of voice over IP technology (VoIP) is driving the adoption of broadband signaling for alarm reporting. Lots of websites requiring alarm setups no longer have conventional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with conventional telephone dialer ability do not work reliably over some types of VoIP service.</p>
<p>What really sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be costly but is essential. In reality, we do not advise purchasing this camera at all unless you prepare to add the subscription. Without it, you won't get the person-detection function, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera identified activity. Having the ability to distinguish between a car and a person, for example, enables you to reduce unneeded signals. And Activity Zones are a great perk, especially if you're aiming to monitor a specific corner of the backyard, an entrance, or even garbage cans. </p>
