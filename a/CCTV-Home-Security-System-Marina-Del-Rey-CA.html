<h3>Home Security Surveillance in California</h3>

<h3>Best Burglar Alarm Marina Del Rey CA 90292</h3>
<p>Depending upon how expansive the location is that you want to cover, the resolution of the CCTV camera you pick will need to reflect the landscape in order to provide a clear, useful image.

<p>What to think about: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 each month, however you'll pay a little bit more if you want to add additional functions, like a security camera. While a typical contract runs 42 months (among the longer contract terms on our list), that requirement is just for users who wish to lease their equipment. Vivint has no minimum contract requirement if you buy your equipment upfront.</p>
<p>So why don't we rank ADT higher? In some ways, ADT annoys us. We see so many growing companies branching out and attempting new things in the home security area. But ADT isn't maintaining. It costs a lot, its rates isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to point out that the customer service experience differs commonly depending on the dealer you choose. </p>
