<p>When motion is spotted, almost all outdoor security cameras are geared up with a motion sensing unit that will trigger the camera to tape-record video. The sensing unit can also start a push alert to your phone when activity is taking place, and some will also produce an email alert.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>

Lots of companies provide package deals that include installation and a basic wireless system at a bargain if you sign up for their monitoring service. When you're feeling old-fashioned, you can manage Vivint security with a keychain remote, a mobile app or the main control panel.</p>
