<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is premium, if not particularly innovative, so we're really suggesting the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan option. Sure, you get a lower price if you go with a three-year agreement, but because Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a big commitment. So select what will be the much better offer for you. If you understand you'll sit tight for a minimum of 3 years, choose the contract and gain those cost savings. However if you may update to a new office with various security requirements, contract-free is your best choice.</p>

It costs a lot, its pricing isn't always transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to mention that the customer support experience varies extensively depending upon the dealership you opt for. </p>
