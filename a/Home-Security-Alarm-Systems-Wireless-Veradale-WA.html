<p>Several other designs were disqualified due to performance concerns. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (approximately 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of up to 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular because the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
