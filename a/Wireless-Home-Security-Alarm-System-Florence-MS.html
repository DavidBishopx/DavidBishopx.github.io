I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker.

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video in the dark is a concern.</p>
