The main difference is that the wired system pairs with the other wise home gadgets to create a network of home security around your home.

A local system does not have the capability to couple with other wise devices and can not be managed remotely. Also a local alarm won't contact the authorities; it simply sets off an audible siren to notify people nearby.</p>
