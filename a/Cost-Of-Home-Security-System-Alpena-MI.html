<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal considering that the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>

Our tester said the technician provided solid customer service: He dropped a few unnecessary window sensing units from my bill after deciding that the motion detector sufficed for the whole front half of my home." However, there were some concerns with connecting the command hub to our tester's network. </p>
