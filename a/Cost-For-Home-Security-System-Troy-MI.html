<h3>Best Home Security Monitoring in Michigan</h3>
<p>Somewhat more expensive than our winning wise alarm, this system was practically as basic to install and, during screening, the loud, clear siren was quick to sound if one of the sensors had been triggered. We enjoy that the system consists of a wifi security camera and just notifies you when motion is created by something with the same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no incorrect signals).

<p>It works with a wire or without, with a Canary Smart base station or without, and can run indoors or inside your home - you get a lot of flexibility from this little gadget. We like the 1080p HD video quality, the 116-degree field of view, the motion detection, and the detachable magnetic base which is easy to install. That's simply $0.66 a day (or about $20 a month) for standard home security equipment and the peace of mind of expert monitoring.</p>
<p>Fixed-mount security cameras are non-discriminating in what they tape-record; everything within their focus capability is caught.
