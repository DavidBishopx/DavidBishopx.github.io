<h3>Home Window Security Greensboro GA 30642</h3>

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>We tried each of the cameras in several areas around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we tested each camera using an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) as well as an Android mobile phone (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint provides a wide variety of equipment and home automation products at a sensible rate, the one location where the company particularly excels remains in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
