<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see in the evening. If catching video footage in the dark is a concern, make sure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big quantity of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for additional circuitry. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, generally via 110VAC power. </p>
