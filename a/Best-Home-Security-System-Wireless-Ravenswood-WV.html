<p>Are privately owned, operated surveillance cameras to be treated the same way as public cameras? We also need to draw fine lines about 'Who truly is enjoying you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'?

The camera might lawfully do what a peeping tom could refrain from doing. They might peer within windows with the full protection of the law on their side.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, but not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for more circuitry. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, normally via 110VAC power. </p>
