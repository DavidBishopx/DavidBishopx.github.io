<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by an expert home security company. When the system discovers a burglary, fire, or other emergency situation, it informs the security group and, in some cases, emergency situation responders.

And with video innovation most likely to continue advancing, the absence of any clear boundaries for what CCTV systems need to be able to do postures a considerable risk.</p>
