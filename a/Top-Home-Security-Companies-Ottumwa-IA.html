So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I remained in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Actually frustrating.

I called their customer care group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to discuss it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the lump amount, due to the fact that apparently they car restore you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a written not by mail.
