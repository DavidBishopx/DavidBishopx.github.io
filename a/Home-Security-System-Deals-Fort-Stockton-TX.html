The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without difficulty. The IR lights during the night are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the cost and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>

<h3>Best House Security System Fort Stockton TX 79735</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first saw Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it rapidly ended up being a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out notifies, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
