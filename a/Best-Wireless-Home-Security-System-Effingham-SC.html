<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we could point them at the very same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had set up on the porch by a licensed electrical expert (who takes place to be my partner).
