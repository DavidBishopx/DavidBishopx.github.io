<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered.

If a house owner forgets their secrets and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is activated by a community cat, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a property owner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
