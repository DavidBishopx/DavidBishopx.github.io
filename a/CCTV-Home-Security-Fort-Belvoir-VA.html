<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually described as shock sensors, are various in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>

To recoup costs and hold alarm companies accountable for false alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company must be certified, pay any registration or incorrect alarm fees, and offer physical proof like camera footage or a damaged window to necessitate police response.</p>
