<p>Consider it by doing this, if a decent still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (US $), how can a more advanced video camera be sold for the low price of forty dollars? It just does not add up. To use such low prices, makers should cut corners, and completion result is compromised efficiency. What good is a surveillance camera that only works preferably in best conditions like bright sunlight? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in particular scenarios such as baby-sitter webcams or signing in on a pet, though when seeking to collect evidence of a criminal offense they often come up short.</p>
