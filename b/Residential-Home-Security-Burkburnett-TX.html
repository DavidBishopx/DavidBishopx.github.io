<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are dependable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for further wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less circuitry in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, usually by means of 110VAC power. </p>
