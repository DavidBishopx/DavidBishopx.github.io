<p>Several other models were disqualified due to performance issues. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (up to 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left spaces of as much as 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had set up on the deck by a certified electrician (who occurs to be my other half). All of the cameras were linked to the exact same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router inside your home (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>

With the more recent system, you will pay more, but that higher rate features a system that is smaller sized, much faster, and stronger. At half the size of the initial system, the tiny sensors are virtually unnoticeable. The new system works 5 times quicker, and the alarm is 50% louder to frighten trespassers. </p>
