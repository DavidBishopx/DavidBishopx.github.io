The other noteworthy things about the Pro 2 are that unlike the Q Plus (the other Arlo design which I'm going to go over in simply a second), it is created for outdoor as well as indoor use, so it'll work come rain or shine. It likewise has a USB slot so you can record your video footage straight onto there, which conserves you having to handle the cloud storage system described above.</p>
<p>When selecting a home security camera is whether you require an indoor or outdoor  camera, the other significant decision.

Thankfully, I have actually evaluated out dozens of cameras and condensed everything I have actually learned into the list listed below.
