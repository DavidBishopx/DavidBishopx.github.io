<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers understand that the economical customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
<p>We attempted each of the cameras in several locations around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service.
