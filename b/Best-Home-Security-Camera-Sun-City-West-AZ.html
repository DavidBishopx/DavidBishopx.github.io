<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly common. If a house owner forgets their secrets and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is set off by a neighborhood feline, it can trigger the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the property owner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms take place. With a self-monitored system, a house owner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
