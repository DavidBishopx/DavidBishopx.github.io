<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technically innovative outdoor camera we have actually checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even recognize individuals you have actually identified (after a learning period). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>What actually sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be costly but is important. In truth, we don't recommend purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to include the membership. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera found activity. Having the ability to compare a person and an automobile, for instance, permits you to minimize unneeded informs. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, particularly if you're wanting to monitor a specific corner of the backyard, an entrance, or even garbage cans. </p>
