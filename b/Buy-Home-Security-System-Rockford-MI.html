Reliability has long been at the heart of the debate over hardwired versus wireless home security systems. It's a debate that's often skewed by factors such as hesitation over the susceptibility of wireless systems, including interference from radio signals and problems that trigger false alarms. While enhancements in the last few years have made the technology more popular and robust (some systems today have their own unique wireless technology, which can't be interfered with by other signals), concerns continue over vulnerabilities that don't affect hardwired systems.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally described as shock sensors, are various because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most extreme frequencies generated are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>

I called their customer service group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to discuss it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the swelling sum, due to the fact that apparently they auto restore you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a composed not by mail.

<p>On the surface, these two camera categories might appear comparable, though if you had the ability to see within, the distinctions become apparent and unique. Commercial-grade cameras are designed and built for high-performance applications where failure is not an option; consumer-grade cameras are not. Usually, consumer-grade cameras are developed to work well when there is a lot of readily available light, and when the lighting ends up being low or absent (believe sundown or nighttime), their pedigree starts to reveal.

<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect sense of security because it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
