<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to discover it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only an incorrect complacency considering that it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
