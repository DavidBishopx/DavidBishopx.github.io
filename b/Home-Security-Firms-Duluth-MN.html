We like that the system includes a wifi security camera and only signals you when motion is developed by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (guaranteeing there's no false signals). However, you do require to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensing units have been activated.
