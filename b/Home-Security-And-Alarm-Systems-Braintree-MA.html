<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system.
