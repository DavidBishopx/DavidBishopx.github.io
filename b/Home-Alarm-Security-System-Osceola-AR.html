<p>Absolutely nothing is more vital than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. Shamicqua and Lt. Gregory made this experience so simple. She was really efficient and had the service set up for us within hours. Lt. Gregory was very responsive to all of our demands. I will highly recommend your services to anybody that requires temporary security. We will definitely be in touch must we need these services once again. It's becoming more popular. But for the time being, if you see an outdoor camera that uses two-way audio, go for it.</p>
<p>A system that requires an agreement may be a clever choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems typically don't included in advance fees. Rather, the expenses are expanded over the length of the contract. We've seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term arrangement (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>

<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were outstanding in our testing-- during the day and during the night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We must note that the camera would periodically downgrade the image quality based upon offered bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day. Nest consists of the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that might defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
