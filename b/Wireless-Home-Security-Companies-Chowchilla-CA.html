<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false complacency since it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
