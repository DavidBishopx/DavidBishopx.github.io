<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>

Alexa support is consisted of, as you would anticipate from an Amazon-owned brand, and the camera properly deals with all the normal functions when it comes to motion detection and two-way audio. Night vision is included too, for when the lights head out. </p>
