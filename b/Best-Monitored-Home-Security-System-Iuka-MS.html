<p>We do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it ought to be. Recordings, alerts, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing out on, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to overlook objects that exert percentages of pressure on the wires.
