<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect sense of security because it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
