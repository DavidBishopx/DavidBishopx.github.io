<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
