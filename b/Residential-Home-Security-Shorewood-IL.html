<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false sense of security considering that it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
