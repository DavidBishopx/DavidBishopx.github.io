<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and functions are almost identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's strategies are somewhat more expensive for the same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation costs are difficult, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyhow.</p>
