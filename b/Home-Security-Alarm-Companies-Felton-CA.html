For instance, if we require to see all video from today that has a patrol car in it, we simply type cops" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a police cruiser appears.

The camera could legally do what a peeping tom might refrain from doing. They could peer within windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If a person was standing enjoying outside a window it might be a crime, yet the same individual could put a surveillance camera then remotely view an individual within the privacy of their home.

Being able to compare a person and an automobile, for example, enables you to reduce unnecessary alerts. And Activity Zones are a good perk, specifically if you're looking to monitor a particular corner of the yard, a doorway, or even garbage cans. </p>
