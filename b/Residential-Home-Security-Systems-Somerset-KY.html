<p>Having family pets indicates you will need to consider their size, motions, and any other factors that could trigger issues. For example, if you have pets that are over 30 pounds, you will need a security system whose motion sensing units can be adjusted or a system that can be set up in such a way that your large family pets will not cause incorrect alarms to be sent out whenever your animal moves.

<p>Several other models were disqualified due to performance concerns. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (approximately 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, frequently buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of up to 90 seconds between videos.</p>
<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its understated looks and face acknowledgment software application. The latter enables you to see exactly when a specific person arrives at your house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. But Netatmo has broadened its security range with a brilliant outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof window and door sensing units referred to as Tags (₤ 89.99). They also plan to launch a clever smoke alarm and siren later this year, which makes this an even better proposition.</p>
