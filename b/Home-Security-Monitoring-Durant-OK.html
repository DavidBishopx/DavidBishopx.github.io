<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey regular monthly charge for a set amount of time, usually one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which allow you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than committing to a long-term arrangement, are becoming more common. These systems often cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that provide a discount in exchange for that prolonged service agreement. Paying for the equipment in advance supplies you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can start and stop the monitoring service as often times as you want.</p>
