<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were excellent in our screening-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video.

<p>Expenses for systems vary. Bigger systems that offer full-house coverage with professional monitoring are the most expensive options.

You press a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's happening on the other end. And while this is a pretty basic feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is relatively rare in outdoor security cameras.</p>
