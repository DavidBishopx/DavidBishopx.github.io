<p>Thank you men for the assistance, what fantastic customer servcie you offer. I bought a small (12) camera wireless system for my home and am quite handy to install it myself.

<p>If you do come across a home invasion emergency situation, you can trigger the 80dB alarm. I am somewhat disappointed by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food processor whereas lots of other alarm are as loud as 90dB and even 105dB. In spite of that, the alarm must suffice to frighten burglars most of the times. To recover costs and hold alarm companies accountable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company need to be accredited, pay any registration or false alarm costs, and supply physical evidence like camera video footage or a damaged window to call for police reaction.</p>
