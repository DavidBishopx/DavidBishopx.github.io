<p>SimpliSafe equipment covers the essentials. But while ADT systems deal with Z-Wave gadgets, SimpliSafe systems don't. This seriously restricts your choices for syncing a SimpliSafe system with third-party clever home gadgets like lights, outlets, thermostats, and locks. If you already have a security gadget from another brand, like a Blink XT camera, it probably will not work with your SimpliSafe system.</p>
<p>Furthermore they can not transfer fluid video, just still frame images or low resolution snippets of video. Blink Security Cameras are a good example of a system we are constantly helping customers replace. As professionals in the industry our suggestions is to keep away. Initially check the suppliers return policy and second keep the receipt if you do buy them.</p>
<p>We tried each of the cameras in multiple areas around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service.
