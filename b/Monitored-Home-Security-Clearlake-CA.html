As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally normal because the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.

In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for more circuitry.

Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera separately, typically via 110VAC power. </p>
