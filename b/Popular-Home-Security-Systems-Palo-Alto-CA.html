For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a concern but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would cause a disturbance in the signal. A wireless bridge is an excellent choice for long variety circumstances where trees and poles are not present.</p>
<p>Among the very first decisions that you'll require to make is if you require a wireless or wired security camera system, and the right answer likely depends on where you mean to position the cameras and components. If you have the high-end of being able to drill holes and run wires, you'll appreciate not needing to handle batteries, and may want to look at a wired system. On the other hand, if running wires isn't reasonable, you'll enjoy the flexibility that Wi-Fi and wireless cameras use. All these considerations will affect what system you ultimately pick. For instance, if you require to capture high-definition surveillance video over long periods, bandwidth is a factor to consider.</p>
