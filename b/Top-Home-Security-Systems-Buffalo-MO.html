<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare individuals and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents consulting with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off.
