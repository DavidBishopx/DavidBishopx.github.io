It's a security camera to think about if you wish to go all-in on the lights, the noise and the audio in order to put burglars off.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal because the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers understand that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
