<p>The very first thing I take a look at in a security system are its system components. Home security market is attempting to offer new devices and technology is progressing. Now, most security systems include a variety of components, such as a base station, security camera, glass, entry, and motion break sensing units, a keypad, and key fobs, to name a few components. But I also appreciate minimalist systems that parts that perform more than one action, like Minut. Some components can make home automation available to you. Whatever the components are (camera, motion sensor, window sensing unit, clever lock, etc.), I want to make sure that they all easily interact with your app that is always at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>

However, the lack of a camera is a significant oversight and they need to upgrade their smart home integration systems.</p>
