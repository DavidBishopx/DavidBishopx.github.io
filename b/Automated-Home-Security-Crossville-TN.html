<p>A taut wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to find any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to ignore things that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
