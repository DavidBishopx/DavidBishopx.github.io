We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
