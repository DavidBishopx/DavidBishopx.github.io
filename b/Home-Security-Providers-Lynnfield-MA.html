We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
