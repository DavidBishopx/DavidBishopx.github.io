<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can identify individuals the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a larger variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
