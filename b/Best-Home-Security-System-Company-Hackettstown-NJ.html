Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

We need to keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based on offered bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day. Nest includes the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
