<p>Likewise called eyeball" cameras, the turret camera has a ball-and-socket joint to let you specifically reroute the field of view without remounting the security camera every time. They're fantastic for storage facilities. Some of these may look like dome cameras, however there's a basic technique to identify them - if the lens and the IR LEDs are in front of the glass on the housing rather than included behind it, you have actually got a turret camera instead of a dome.</p>
<p>What really sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be costly but is necessary. In fact, we do not advise buying this camera at all unless you plan to add the subscription. Without it, you will not get the person-detection function, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity.
