So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I remained in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Truly irritating. Once again the sales people, or at least mine, do not discuss the 3 year commitment. I called their customer service team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to mention it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the lump amount, because apparently they car restore you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a written not by mail.  ADT is a nightmare, method too expensive, and not fantastic.</p>
