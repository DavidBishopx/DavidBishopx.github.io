<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically safer, however after reading this post, it will sure make you feel essentially susceptible. A couple of minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control panel up and online-- it just would not connect. A help window popped up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint representative assisted her troubleshoot the connection.
