<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between people and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
