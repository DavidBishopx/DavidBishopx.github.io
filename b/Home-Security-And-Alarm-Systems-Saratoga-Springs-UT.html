<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, but not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for additional electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera separately, normally through 110VAC power. </p>
