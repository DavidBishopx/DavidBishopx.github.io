<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a pleasure to utilize as well (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you want to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a little a knowing curve. For even more basic smarts, it's great, though. If you don't already have an Arlo camera or more in location, you're going to require to install a center that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the hub (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can indicate there are range issues.</p>
