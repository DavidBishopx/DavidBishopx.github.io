We would recommend considering a DIY home security system rather if you desire to prevent having to sign a contract.</p>

Wireless cameras can't have all of it-- enjoy things inside by day, and watch on what's going on outside after dark. It rarely works.</p>

Our tester said the service technician offered strong customer care: He dropped a few unneeded window sensing units from my costs after deciding that the motion detector sufficed for the whole front half of my home." However, there were some issues with linking the command hub to our tester's network. </p>
