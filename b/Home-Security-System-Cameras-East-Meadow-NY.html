<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize people the camera is spotting utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name.

We also discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
