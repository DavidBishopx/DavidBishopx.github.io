<p>A number of other designs were disqualified due to efficiency issues. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its understated looks and face recognition software application. The latter allows you to see specifically when a specific individual arrives at your house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time. However Netatmo has actually broadened its security variety with a dazzling outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof doors and window sensors called Tags (₤ 89.99). They also prepare to introduce a wise smoke alarm and siren later on this year, that makes this an even much better proposal.</p>
