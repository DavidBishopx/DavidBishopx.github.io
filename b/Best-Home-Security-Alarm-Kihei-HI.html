However it can feel daunting to sift through whatever out there to find a good match.</p>
<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk with an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near to the NVR is absolutely something to be thought about. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would cause an interruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is a fantastic alternative for long range circumstances where trees and poles are not present.</p>
<p>Installation - Who will set up the equipment? Companies like House, SimpliSafe, and Frontpoint sell equipment for DIY setup. You can receive equipment in the mail, and set up typically takes a few minutes to an hour. On the other hand, ADT and Vivint have professional installation; they send somebody to your home. Often there is an installation charge.</p>
<p>Naturally, the obvious disadvantage to a wired security system is that the preliminary install can be pricey.

Wired security systems are also vulnerable to power interruptions.

<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, suggesting that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and could even activate incorrect alarms. False alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the cops if they take place frequently enough. Another prospective disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be changed or charged frequently in order to keep the system working.
