<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak to an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near the NVR is absolutely something to be thought about. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would cause a disturbance in the signal.

When the system finds a burglary, fire, or other emergency situation, it alerts the security team and, in some cases, emergency responders.
