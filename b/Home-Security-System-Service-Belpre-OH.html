<p>Once upon a time, setting up a security system could be a very costly affair: A professional monitoring company would offer the equipment, locking you into a pricey, multi-year contract.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just an incorrect complacency considering that it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
