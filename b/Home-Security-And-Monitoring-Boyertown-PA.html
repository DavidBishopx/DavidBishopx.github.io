<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment in this manner to make clients stay with them longer, due to the fact that switching monitoring companies indicates hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for clients. Alexa support is included, as you would expect from an Amazon-owned brand name, and the camera effectively manages all the typical functions when it concerns motion detection and two-way audio. Night vision is included too, for when the lights go out. </p>
