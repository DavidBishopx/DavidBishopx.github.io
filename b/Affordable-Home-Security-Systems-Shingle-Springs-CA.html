<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear footage in dark conditions.

Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. If recording video in the dark is a priority, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
