<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular because the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the store.
