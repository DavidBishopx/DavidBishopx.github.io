<p>Vivint's monitoring fees are in line with our other top security companies, which is outstanding given the advanced exclusive equipment and services that feature a Vivint home security system.

<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by an expert home security company.

Unfortunately, history has actually revealed that surveillance technologies put in place for one purpose inevitably broaden into other uses. And with video innovation likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear borders for what CCTV systems need to have the ability to do poses a significant threat.</p>

The camera consists of functions like complimentary streamable HD video and audio, 30-day storage, and night vision, but it doesn't take pictures of activity and can't pan or move-- basic functions discovered on a lot of surveillance cameras. </p>
