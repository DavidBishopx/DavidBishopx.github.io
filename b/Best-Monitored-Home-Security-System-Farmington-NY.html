<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize people the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those people and will send mobile phone informs with that info when they show up at your home.

We also discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
