<p>We provide value-added security and surveillance systems and services providing benefit, peace of mind and fulfillment to every consumer and are dedicated to satisfying our client's needs with integrity, sincerity, enthusiasm and outstanding service. Dependability has actually long been at the heart of the dispute over hardwired versus wireless home security systems. It's an argument that's typically skewed by elements such as uncertainty over the susceptibility of wireless systems, consisting of interference from radio signals and problems that cause false alarms. While enhancements in the last few years have made the technology more popular and robust (some systems today have their own special wireless technology, which can't be disrupted by other signals), concerns persist over vulnerabilities that don't affect hardwired systems.</p>

<p>Recording the footage from your security cameras requires hard disk drives or cloud based storage. If you have an analog security camera system, then the digital video recorder (DVR) that the security cameras are connected to has a hard disk within it. If your dealing with taped video storage on an IP camera system, then your network video recorder (NVR) can utilize hard drives for on-site recording and cloud-based recording in the event of disk drive breakdown.</p>

<p>In overall, the company runs 12 well-staffed security monitoring centers around the country, in addition to 200 local offices, making sure that consumers are well-attended to. As far as equipment goes, ADT's uses products from numerous manufacturers, including General Electric and Honeywell, in its systems rather that self-produced equipment. This suggests that customers have plenty to choose from.</p>
<p>What to think about: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 per month, however you'll pay a little bit more if you wish to include extra functions, like a security camera. While a typical agreement runs 42 months (one of the longer agreement terms on our list), that requirement is only for users who want to lease their equipment. Vivint has no minimum contract requirement if you buy your equipment upfront.</p>
<p>So why don't we rank ADT greater? In some methods, ADT frustrates us. We see so many growing companies branching out and trying new things in the home security space. However ADT isn't keeping up. It costs a lot, its pricing isn't always transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to point out that the client service experience varies commonly depending upon the dealership you go with. </p>
