<p>Another crucial topic to go over is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand just how much is enough. In this post, the term resolution" refers to the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video image; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The very same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about 4 times as much photo details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. When it concerns surveillance cameras, there are some challenging effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always better.</p>
