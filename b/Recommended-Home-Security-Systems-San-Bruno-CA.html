Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. When it concerns surveillance cameras, there are some challenging effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always better.</p>
