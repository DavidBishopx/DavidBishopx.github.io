<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to discover it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false complacency considering that it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. If recording video footage in the dark is a concern, ensure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
