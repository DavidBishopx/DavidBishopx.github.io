<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus scams, vandalism, and theft. You get 1080p HD streaming, a 130-degree field of view, the usual movement notifies, and a 90+ dB alarm that is likely to frighten any approaching burglar before they've got too far into your home. When you're at home and don't want to be tape-recorded, the privacy-conscious will be pleased to hear there's a physical shutter you can close over the camera.</p>
<p>The greatest drawback of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensing unit gets activated while you're away, you have no visual means of validating if something is really incorrect and how major the situation is. If the alarm event is figured out to be an incorrect alarm, the city will mail a billing summarizing the occurrence and assessing a charge, if any.</p>
