<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
