Installation can be complex - particularly if your home has already been developed - so make certain to consult with a professional prior to taking on the task yourself.

We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is super reasonable, so it's not a total splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>
