<p>The Hive View delivers terrific 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting. Since this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to by hand stop notifications (and recording, given that it does that even when notifications are off).

<p>The cover of darkness isn't enough to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view.
