Due later this spring, the D-Link DCS-8302LH is a $100 outdoor camera with a 1080p image, person detection, glass-break detection, a built-in siren, and the choice for a wired Ethernet connection.

<p>Consumers can pick amongst 3 package tiers, each of which offers a different set-up of functions, from basic monitoring with the Protection plan to live video streaming with the Ultimate strategy.

<h3>Residential Alarm Systems in Hayes VA</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.

Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
