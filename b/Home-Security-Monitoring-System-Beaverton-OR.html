Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect complacency considering that it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
