<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to find it.
