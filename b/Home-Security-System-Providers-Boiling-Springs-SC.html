<p>Thanks to current advancements in innovation, wireless security systems are now as reliable as wired systems If you've decided to install a burglar alarm, you need to consider the following benefits of wireless technology. By integrating LiveWatch DIY security systems with Moni's professional monitoring, we can see Brinks Home Security taking on other huge names in the industry. Throughout our hands-on screening of Brinks, we found the systems to be somewhat easy to establish and use-- however not quite as easy as brand names like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm. Get home security and wise home automation without all the agreements and monthly fees.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively common. If a property owner forgets their secrets and goes back within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is set off by a neighborhood feline, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a house owner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>

<p>Whether you choose to choose a DIY system or opt for an expertly set up system, you'll need to pay a regular monthly or annual  cost if you require monitoring, and sometimes, you'll be struck with a regular monthly charge to settle the cost of hardware components. With the majority of DIY systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Kit, the Ring Alarm Security Set, and the Nest Secure, you acquire the hardware outright and can avoid any regular monthly charges if you choose to self-monitor. If you add monitoring, fees will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 each month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 per month. The price of the Nest service drops to $19 per month if you commit to a three-year agreement. Ring's Protect Plus plan chooses $10 each month and does not need a contract.</p>
