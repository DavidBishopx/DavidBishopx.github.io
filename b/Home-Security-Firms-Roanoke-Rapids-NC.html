Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are nearly similar to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's strategies are somewhat more expensive for the same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation fees are onerous, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyway.</p>
