Nowadays, it's a lot easier to have a standalone security camera. Whether you have one camera or a number of, they deal with your home's web network to send video right to your computer system or mobile device. The majority of customer cameras store information internally, on a detachable microSD card, or remotely on the cloud.</p>

However beyond the privacy concerns of police's widespread access to historic and real-time video footage lies the danger of it being accessed by destructive hackers.

<p>Even though 1080p is usually the basic resolution for cameras we've evaluated, there are benefits to designs with higher-resolution sensing units. Couple of home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but nearly all have digital zoom, which crop and expand whatever the camera is recording.

<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and features are almost similar to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's strategies are somewhat more expensive for the same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation fees are difficult, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyway.</p>
