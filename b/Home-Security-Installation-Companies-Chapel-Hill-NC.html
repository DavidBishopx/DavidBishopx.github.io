<h3>Home Burglar Alarm Systems Chapel Hill NC 27516</h3>
<p>Contact among our security specialists with any concerns you might have about home alarm monitoring. While it might come as a surprise, alarm system have been around for over 150 years. In truth, the second half of the 19th century was a period of excellent innovation in the security market. The first home alarm system was patented in 1853 by a Bostonian developer named Augustus Russell Pope.</p>
<p>Home security companies offer a wide variety of equipment alternatives, from installed control panel installations to totally automated systems controlled by mobile phones or tablets. Some companies make and offer their own exclusive equipment, while others count on third-party products. Specific home security systems require professional installation.

<p>We attempted each of the cameras in multiple places around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we checked each camera utilizing an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) in addition to an Android smart device (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint uses a wide variety of equipment and home automation products at an affordable cost, the one location where the company especially excels remains in DIY installation. </p>
