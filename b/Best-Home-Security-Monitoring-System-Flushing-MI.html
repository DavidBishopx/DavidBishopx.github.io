<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has clearly tried to give it an attractive edge, and we need to give credit to its capability to show what's going on from as much as 4 cameras at a time. It can be slow and awkward to use on event - with the procedure of linking to the camera for a live view rather languid at times. The previous, cheaper variation of the outdoor Nest cam is still on sale too if you want to save some money - it does have actually a cable attached however, instead of working wirelessly, which indicates it's a bit much easier to mess up for potential burglars. Definitely one of the best security cameras in 2020.</p>
