<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not especially cutting-edge, so we're truly advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy option. Sure, you get a lower price if you choose a three-year contract, but considering that Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So select what will be the better offer for you. If you understand you'll sit tight for a minimum of 3 years, go with the contract and enjoy those cost savings.
