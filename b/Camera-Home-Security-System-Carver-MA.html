<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly advanced outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and individuals, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even determine people you've identified (after a learning duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>Reliability is a highly subjective when it comes to technology matter, depending on which functions and advantages an individual favors. Wireless security systems are more nimble and integratable, but low signal strength and bad connection are still typical grievances. Hardwired systems require very little maintenance, and except a general power failure, are more difficult to interrupt. Despite a basic improvement in wireless technology, there seem fewer methods for hardwired systems to be disrupted and incapacitated. </p>
