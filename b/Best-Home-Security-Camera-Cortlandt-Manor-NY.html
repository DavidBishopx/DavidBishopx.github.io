<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

Some NVR systems, for example, are compatible with the IP cameras only from specific manufacturers and not others. When purchasing a video recorder, you must first make certain that the gadget will deal with the cameras you have actually purchased. If you're working with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system, the cameras must have the ability to offer you with the necessary info.</p>
