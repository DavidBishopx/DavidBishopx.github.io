Do you wish to terrify them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will suffice.

It can compare general motion and individuals, so it cuts down on incorrect alarms, and it can even determine people you've identified (after a learning period). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
