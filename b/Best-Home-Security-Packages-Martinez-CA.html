Asset protection gadgets are created to protect specific, concrete assets, such as jewelry, paintings, money boxes, and family treasures. These gadgets can be equipped with anti-tampering technology to avoid being disarmed.

<p>Today's wireless home security systems connect to your favorite home automation brands for seamless connectivity. Brands such as Ring, August or Nest enable you to create automated routines such as turning off lights and lowering your thermostat's temperature level when you leave for work and inspect your security system is equipped.

We particularly like this camera's large, 180-degree field of view, because you're less most likely to get a blind spot wherever you set it up. For less than $400, you get two door and window sensors, one motion detector, and a video doorbell with two-way talk.</p>
