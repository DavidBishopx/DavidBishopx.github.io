<p>Recently, Ring denied reports that it had actually suffered a data breach, however we agree with its recommendation that users need to reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a precautionary procedure. All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such events.

While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video items, we do not think that these concerns modify the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our current recommendation.</p>
