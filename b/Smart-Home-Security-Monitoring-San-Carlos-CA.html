<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety.
