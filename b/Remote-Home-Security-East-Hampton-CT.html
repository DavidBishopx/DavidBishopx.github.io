<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal because the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
