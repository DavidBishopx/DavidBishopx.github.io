<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical since the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

Although FrontPoint provides a wide array of equipment and home automation items at a sensible price, the one location where the company particularly excels is in DIY installation. </p>
