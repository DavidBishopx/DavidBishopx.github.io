Once again the sales people, or at least mine, do not point out the 3 year commitment. I called their customer service group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to mention it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the swelling sum, since obviously they car restore you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a written not by mail.
