<p>Customer care is Frontpoint's specialty. While the company does not use rather as numerous hours of client assistance as other brand names, it has a wonderful credibility with lots of vocal, happy consumers.

<p>Whether you decide to opt for a Do It Yourself system or go with an expertly set up system, you'll need to pay a monthly or annual  charge if you need monitoring, and in many cases, you'll be hit with a monthly charge to settle the cost of hardware parts. With a lot of DIY systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Kit, the Ring Alarm Security Set, and the Nest Secure, you buy the hardware outright and can avoid any month-to-month costs if you decide to self-monitor. If you include monitoring, costs will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 per month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 monthly. If you commit to a three-year contract, the rate of the Nest service drops to $19 monthly. Ring's Protect Plus strategy chooses $10 monthly and doesn't need a contract.</p>

We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.
