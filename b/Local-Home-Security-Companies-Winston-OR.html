<h3>Home Security Alert System in Oregon</h3>
<p>A wired security camera can come in 2 types, both needing wires to supply power and for the functions of video transmission.

There are just two choices if there are no as-built documents providing functionality and setup info to make this combination work. The first choice, which might be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original option provider is unwilling or not available to provide those details) and document the topology and how they can be included into the new DVS system. The other approach is to rip and change, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to converge them all.</p>
