<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular since the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients understand that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
