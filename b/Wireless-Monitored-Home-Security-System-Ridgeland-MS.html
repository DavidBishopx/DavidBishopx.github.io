<h2>DIY Wifi Home Security Systems Ridgeland</h2>
<p>After we utilized the Anker EufyCam for almost six months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to provide on its pledge of up to one year of battery life. What we do not love is that it leaves spaces in between recordings, which varied anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending on the settings.

<p>The Hive View delivers terrific 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation triggered too easily, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Since this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to by hand stop alerts (and recording, considering that it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connection issues, with 2 Hive test units detaching eight times over 2 months.</p>
<p>Think about it by doing this, if a decent still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (US $), how can a more advanced video camera be cost the low price of forty dollars? It just does not accumulate. To offer such low prices, producers must cut corners, and the end result is compromised performance. What good is a surveillance camera that just works ideally in ideal conditions like brilliant sunshine? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in specific situations such as nanny web cams or checking in on a pet, though when seeking to gather evidence of a crime they typically lose.</p>

The rebate is solely for the cost of the camera( s) including any relevant tax.</p>
