<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular because the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
