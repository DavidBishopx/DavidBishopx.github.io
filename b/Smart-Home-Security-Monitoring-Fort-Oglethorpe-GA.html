<p>On the surface area, these 2 camera classifications might appear similar, though if you had the ability to see inside, the distinctions end up being unique and apparent. Commercial-grade cameras are developed and built for high-performance applications where failure is not a choice; consumer-grade cameras are not. Usually, consumer-grade cameras are constructed to work well when there is lots of available light, and when the lighting becomes absent or low (think sunset or nighttime), their pedigree begins to show.
