<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively typical. If a property owner forgets their secrets and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is activated by a community cat, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the property owner will be called by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly. False alarms happen.

Most companies provide house owners the capability to add additional components like another camera, contact sensors, a panic button, keypad, smoke alarm, carbon monoxide detectors, or a key fob.</p>
