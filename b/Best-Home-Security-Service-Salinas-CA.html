The same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about four times as much picture details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise manufactured in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.

<h3>Alarm And Camera Security System Salinas CA 93905</h3>
<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016.

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we could point them at the very same area and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather.
