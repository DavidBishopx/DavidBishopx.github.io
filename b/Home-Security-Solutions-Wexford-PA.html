<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
<p>We attempted each of the cameras in multiple areas around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we evaluated each camera using an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) as well as an Android mobile phone (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint offers a wide array of equipment and home automation items at a reasonable price, the one area where the company especially excels is in DIY installation. </p>
