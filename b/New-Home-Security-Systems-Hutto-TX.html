For the ones that do not, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home at any time you access your system; however, nothing is taped. The systems with video storage typically consist of either a local storage or cloud storage option. A local storage option saves a pre-determined number of video clips on the gadget itself.

<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reputable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for more electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, typically by means of 110VAC power. </p>
