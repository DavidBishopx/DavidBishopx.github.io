We enjoy that the system includes a wifi security camera and only informs you when motion is produced by something with the exact same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no incorrect alerts). However, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensors have actually been activated.
