<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to ignore things that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
