<p>Absolutely nothing is more crucial than protecting what you treasure most ... your family and home. The implicit justification for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the hazard of terrorist attacks. But suicide assaulters are clearly not prevented by video cameras - and might even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can guarantee - and the expenditure of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up roughly 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget plan - far surpasses the minimal advantages that the system might provide in investigating attacks or tried attacks after the truth (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

If you have an analog security camera system, then the digital video recorder (DVR) that the security cameras are connected to has a hard disk within it.
