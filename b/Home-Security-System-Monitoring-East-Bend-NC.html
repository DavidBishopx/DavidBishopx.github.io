<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to detect it.
