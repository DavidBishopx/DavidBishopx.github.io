It only gets triggered when a human can be found in close proximity since it uses infrared sensing units and mass detection to differentiate in between people and other inanimate objects or smaller living things.

There's no latency so you get alerted right away so you can take immediate actions such as setting off a loud alarm, contacting the authorities, or using the camera's two-way audio system to speak to the prospective trespassers.</p>
<p>Our burglar alarms may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to acknowledge a violation. When a zone has actually been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. When the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the alarm system's keypad and turning off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
