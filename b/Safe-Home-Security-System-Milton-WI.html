<p>We don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complicated than it must be. Recordings, notifies, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>Camera compatibility: Not every video recorder can work with every camera. Obviously, DVRs need analog cameras, while NVRs use IP cameras, but the compatibility concern extends well beyond that difference.

When purchasing a video recorder, you must initially make sure that the gadget will deal with the cameras you've bought. If you're dealing with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system, the cameras must be able to offer you with the necessary information.</p>
