<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can identify people the camera is finding utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
