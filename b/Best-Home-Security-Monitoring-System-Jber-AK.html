<p>Extremely simply, the individual at the door presses the button. You'll get a notification to your phone (you can also get a Ring Chime WiFi extender if you desire a doorbell sound too.) The camera then streams a video-link to your phone (or Amazon Echo Program, if you have among those) - and given that it works as an intercom, you can then have a chat with the person at the door if you so dream.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function.

As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
