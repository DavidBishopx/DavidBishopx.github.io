We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest).

<h3>Small Security Cameras Blakely GA 39823</h3>
<p>Several other designs were disqualified due to efficiency problems. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

We also discovered the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
