The latter enables you to see exactly when a particular person gets to the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time. However Netatmo has expanded its security variety with a dazzling outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof window and door sensors known as Tags (₤ 89.99).
